let's roll bro!!

ok so the first thing is the session logger
	I implemented a similar system for Neocities so I should probably start by checking out that pattern
		https://github.com/ClemsonTRACE/neocitiesV2/blob/master/src/App.js
	I need to clean up my GH badly ahah
	ok so looking at the Neocities session logger
		setInterval()
			if training
			else 
				if not waiver
					if global time < global session length
						if user is player A
							update time
					else
						final page
		ugh I need to stop listneing to songs with lyrics
			this MGMT remix is more like it
		ok so back to this
	the pattern should be very similar
		I still set the interval and check the state location 
			wait, don't I do this already?
		see, gt4t is all about url routing
			should I create an ad-hoc session logger just for 3pd?
				probably, I mean I guess I'd be down to move the logic into the App component if needs change
			uhm, and yet I need to add a new option of how many human players there are
				Ima add that to the container componennt, although it's gonna break the priors
				I'll just leave them a message to change the urls slightly 
		the alternative option is to treat it as a separate game like centipede
			that might be good actually
			let's see, what do I have to pass down?
			Yes!! It worked
	uhm, wait so let's build the 3PD first otherwise I'll get confused
		ok done with the url patterns
		damn it, looks like I have to implement this as a tree
			yeee, D3.js tree!
			so close!!! 
			hell yes!!! woot woot  
		OMG yes, I was able to transfter all of this to the component so it works!!

	currentScore was pretty easy
	Win rate is gonna be harder
		how many cases are there exactly?
			let's look at the server
				https://github.com/ClemsonTRACE/gameTheory4Teams/blob/master/games/utils.py
			it's 8 cases
		oh no!! the training was off 
			jk: 0 is cooperate and 1 is defect
		boom! done
